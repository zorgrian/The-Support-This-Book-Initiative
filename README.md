# The-Support-This-Book-Initiative
**The Support This Book Initiative** helps authors **legally** share knowledge and creativity to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world. 

**The Support This Book Initiative**, helps unlock the full potential of the internet to enable a new era of development, growth, and productivity; where support is given directly to the authors.

### Why Do We Need The Support This Book Initiative? 
**The Support This Book Initiative**, is born out of the need to provide an alternative to the prevailing bloated e-book selling systems now found on the internet. This Initiative reciprocates the author in a manner that is fair & that helps to keep e-books alive. The large corporate e-book system fails to do this, it *sucks* up to 99% of the author's money and in many notable cases **robs authors of their copyright**, thus preventing them from republishing elsewhere without taking legal measures.**This Initiative is not a corporate organisation.** Instead, it is just *a way of doing things*. 

## Have a book to publish?
**If you are an author who has a book to publish you may want to study these documents.**
